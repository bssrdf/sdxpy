## The Problem

-   Most pages on a site share some content

-   Many pages want to be customized based on data

-   So many sites use a templating system

    -   Turn data and HTML page with embedded directives into final page

---

## Design Options

1.  Embed commands in an existing language like [EJS][ejs]

2.  Create a mini-language with its own commands like [Jekyll][jekyll]

3.  Put directives in specially-named attributes in the HTML

[% figure
   slug="template-options"
   img="design_options.svg"
   alt="Three options for page templates"
   caption="Three different ways to implement page templating."
%]

-   We will use the third option so that we don't have to write a parser

---

## What Does Done Look Like?

[%inc loop.ht %]

-   `z-loop`: repeat this

-   `z-num`: a constant number

-   `z-var`: fill in a variable

-   `z-if`: conditional

---

## What Does Done Look Like?

[%inc loop.out %]

-   HTML doesn't care about extra blank lines, so we won't either

---

## How Do We Call This?

-   Design the [%g api "API" %] of our library first

[%inc example_call.py %]

-   In real life, `data` would come from a configuration file or database

---

## Managing Variables

-   Could use a `ChainMap`, but we'll write our own

[%inc env.py mark=body %]

---

## Visiting Nodes

-   Use the [%g visitor_pattern "Visitor" %] design pattern

[%inc visitor.py %]

---

## Expanding a Template

[%inc expander.py mark=construct %]

-   The environment

-   Handlers for our special node types

-   The result (strings we'll concatenate at the end)

---

## Open…

[%inc expander.py mark=open %]

-   If this is text, "display" it

-   If this is a special node, run a function

-   Otherwise, show the opening tag

-   Return value is "do we proceed"?

---

## …and Close

[%inc expander.py mark=close %]

-   Handlers come in open/close pairs

    -   Because some might need to do cleanup

---

## Managing Handlers

[%inc expander.py mark=handlers %]

-   `hasHandler` looks for attributes with special names

-   `getHandler` gets the one we need

---

## But What's a Handler?

[%inc z_num.py %]

-   A module with `open` and `close` functions

-   None of our handlers need state, so we don't need objects

---

## Variables Are Similar

[%inc z_var.py %]

-   We should think about error handling…

---

## Testing

[%inc template.py %]

---

## Static Text

-   If this doesn't work, nothing else will

[%inc static_text.ht %]
[%inc static_text.out %]

---

## Constants

[%inc single_constant.ht %]
[%inc single_constant.out %]

---

## Variables

[%inc single_variable.ht %]
[%inc single_variable.out %]

-   Input is a JSON file containing `{"varName": "varValue"}`

---

## Conditionals

[%inc z_if.py %]

-   The handler determines whether to show this tag and go deeper

-   What if the variable's value changes between opening and closing?

---

## Testing

[%inc conditional.ht %]
[%inc conditional.out %]

-   With JSON `{"yes": True, "no": False}`

---

## Loops

1.  Create a new stack frame holding the current value of the loop variable

1.  Expand all of the node's children with that stack frame in place

1.  Pop the stack frame to get rid of the temporary variable

---

## Loops

[%inc z_loop.py %]

-   The most complicated handler yet

---

## Testing

[%inc loop.ht %]
[%inc loop.out %]

---

## Next Steps

-   The `z-if` issue might mean we need state after all

-   Tackle that before going any further

-   And figure out how to do unit testing
